# rover
firstly i take the intial values from form and but it inform variables .. 
instead of using nested if else statements ..
using maping.. it seems easy to use maping with variables 
as i use it on rotation .. it does not take more than one line to rotate it with using maping ..
try to use less switch cases but while using maping .. 
cannot give key of the object dynamically when calling function..
after search on patterns as Strategy Pattern .. 
it will lead  to same end as cannot access it dynamically as in rover-Strategy.js file
rover-Strategy.js file doesnot need it to run project but i was just trying not to use switch cases .. 
the aim of not using nested if/else is done and no nested cases .. 
.. the end function at the last line of code is the main function ..
as it on click on show button it call follow function which take variables from form 
then work on command chars to get final result on  final record variable and showed on alert 

there is a for loop in the last lines of code is commented .. it work for obstacles to stop moving ... it doesnot work with me .. 
if it works i will overrider final record and declare it before function and add stopped and break loops as boolean variable do but doesnot work ..
